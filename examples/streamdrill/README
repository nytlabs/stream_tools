streamdrill block
=================

streamdrill is a real-time event analysis engine which does three things:

It counts activities over a large set of objects.
It aggregates these counts over timescales ranging from seconds to weeks.
It let's you query the top most active objects instantly.

More informatio can be obtained here:

	http://demo.streamdrill.com/docs/?p=intro#features

1. download the streamdrill demo from http://streamdrill.com
   (move the streamdrill.jar file to this directory)
2. run streamdrill using the script provided in this directory:
   ./streamdrill.sh
3. run streamtools and create your blocks

The configuration of a streamdrill block is very simple. The input
is expected to be JSON.

a) create a name for your streamdrill trend
b) add entities as a colon separated list:

If your input JSON looks like this:
	{"city":"Berlin, "station":"Alexanderplatz"}

enter .city:.station to create a trend that tracks co-occurences of
city and station.

c) [optional] if you want to have averages of a certain value add
   the value selector like .count

Again, the JSON:
  {"city":"Berlin", "station":"Alexanderplatz", "count":3}

This makes sense if the count is not the total count so far, but the
new arrivals after the last time such an event arrived for the same
city and station. The value is then represented as an average over
your selected time frame for the counts. The default is 1.

d) pipe some data in
e) open http://localhost:9669/dashboard/#!/

You can view the individual trends and even drill into subtrends, like
checking the most frequented stations for "Berlin" with in a certain
time frame (currently the default configuration tracks day, hour minute).

** The Wikipedia Demo **

The Wikipedia loads the wikipedia dumps remotely and creates some fake
JSON to pipe into streamtools via UDP. If you get blocked for starting
the script too often, get a local copy and edit wikipedia-stream.pl.

a) start streamtools: build/st
b) start streamdrill: examples/streamdrill/streamdrill.sh
c) load demo:
curl -d @examples/streamdrill/wikipedia.json http://localhost:7070/import

d) run source stream: perl wikipedia-stream.pl

You may use streamtools to query the results using the REST interface:
